# Statistical Dispersion

This is a repository to support any applications that calculate statistical dispersion

Here you will find the Average, Median and Quartile Functions, as well as the Variance, Standard Deviation and Coefficient of Variation Functions.

In addition to the functions there are six lists with raw data that I used to test the functions.
